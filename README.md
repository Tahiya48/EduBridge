## SDLC Overview:
The project follows an Agile scrum approach. First, requirements were collected and organised in a product backlog and then sprint planning and iterative prototype development was performed. Trello was used to manage user stories, track sprint tasks and monitor progress with the help of kanban boards, while GitHub was used  for the documentation of SDLC phases such as design artifacts, testing feedback, improvements and also record project progress.
